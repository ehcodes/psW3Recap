// Instructions: Follow the prompts and make sure to check your answer in the console. Some of the methods I am requiring for you to us we didn't do in class yet. That's on purpose, if you need assistance look back in lessons, and of course Google. :) 

// =================================================
//                     VARIABLES
// =================================================

// 1.) Declare a variable

// 2.) Change the value of this variable

// 3.) Change the data type of this variable

// 4.) Create another variable and the one from above to concatenate

// 5.) Use any of the variables above or create new ones and print using string interpolation

// ================ Variable Names =================
/* 
    • Case-sentive! Try it out! :O
    • Can contain letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
    • Can't start with 0-9
    • Can't use reserved keywords in JS such as var, function, return, etc. 
*/

// =================================================
//                      STRINGS
// =================================================

// Look up the following string methods!

// Using charAt(), print the letter i in Sabrina

// Define Unicode in a comment, and get the Unicode using charCodeAt() of the third character in Teddy

// Using fromCharCode() - make it readable for us :). You'll see!

// Take your first and last name and concat()

// Create a string and make it return true using startsWith()

// Now use any variable with endsWith() and return false

// Finish the following sentence. Use includes() and return true.
const ozgur = 'Once upon a time Ozgur looked up at the Moon, '

// Help! I'm looking for my cow! Using indexOf() help Josh find his cow. What's the index of cow?
const joshHadALittleLambOopsCow = "Josh lives in a farm. Josh was overwhelmed with coding. Josh is stressed out. Josh fed the chickens this morning. He watered his plants. He took his cow Betsy on a walk. Josh went home without Betsy. Josh went to bed that night, and realized he went home alone."

// Oh no! The alien doppelgangers are here. Let's use our laserbeam lastIndexOf() to shoot down the last alien named Vanessa in the String Universe.

const vanessa = "I am the Alpha Vanessa. I am the Omega Vanessa. We do not come in peace."

// Can we use length for strings? I don't know, you tell me.
const noWeCantTeo = "but did you try it out though?"

// If only it was this easy to replace() my ex. Totally not joking, LOL. JK
const replaceGokuWithVegeta = "For my DBZ fans, we all know Goku is the best!"

// Josh has been forgetful lately. Let's help Josh by using search(), and find their right 'wifey'. 
const joshIsLookingForWifey = "WIFEY 1, wifey 2, WiFeY 3, Wifey 4"

// I guess we can share this pizza sentence. Use slice() to return the other half of pizza.
const pizzaSentence = "pizza, other half of pizza"

// Now using the pizza sentence, return only pizza (before the comma)

// Okay, but who decided to go to this expensive restaurant? Yaz, Poornima, and Leshawn decided to split() the bill. Return an array separating Yaz, Poornima, and Leshawn.
const splitTheBill = "Yaz, Poornima, and Leshawn"

// OH NO! The alien invaders from earlier were so against bill splitting so they decided to split() Yaz, Poornima, and Leshawn into pieces. Using splitTheBill, return an array separating all three by characters.

// Use this toLowerCase()
const angry = "LOWER YOUR VOICE DOWN IF YOU AIN'T PAYING MY BILLS."
// Tuan was angry today. Create a string with words that Tuan would yell out. Now lowercase it, to tell Tuan to chill out. 

// toUpperCase()
const jahlunSaidToPutSomeRespectToHisName = "jahlun"

// substring()
// on the chopping block...

// Returns "ell"
const basicGreeting = "Hello World"

// Returns "JavaScript"
const ohReally = "JavaScript Substring"

// Returns aol.com
const aslDays = "xXteoWuzHereXx@aol.com"

// trim()
// If only I can use this for my love handles...
// Create a variable with a string value with some extra loving on both sides.

// =================================================

// =================================================

// I just want my dreams to come true. 
// With the powers of logical and comparison operators, PRINT TRUE please!
// Replace the underscores.

// =================================================
//                     LOOPS
// =================================================

// Ken has a headache today and he said the room has been spinning like crazy. Make Ken's room spin 10 times using FOR LOOP. Make him print a sentence.

// Harry said that was so mean of Teo to do Ken dirty like that. Make Teo's vision spin 20 times FOR LOOP.

// But wait! Lisa said, while Teo is spinning 20 times. Let's make him say "I'm sorry". Print I'm sorry 20 times using a WHILE loop.

// For the next three, look for the syntax of FOR IN and FOR OF loop. Very easy to understand syntax, and very clean :) 

// To The Left! To The Left! Everything I want in the console to the left. Print thing1, thing2, thing 3 using (FOR IN LOOP)

// Look into forEach() loop, it accepts a callback aka a function inside a function. 
// Swathi said don't forget each person. No person left behind! Use forEach() to iterate over the array perscholas. Inside the function, create a variable with the string "PS". Print their name in the console concatenated with the variable. 
const perscholas = ['Amira', 'Arely', 'Jonathan']

// =================================================
//                     ARRAYS
// =================================================

// Look up the following: Make a note of what each one of these methods do
// push()
// pop()
// unshift()
// shift()
// concat()
// splice()
// slice()
// sort()
// includes()
// indexOf()
// length

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

// Print banana

// Let's turn it up a notch. I won't tell you what array methods to use. 

// Join all the elements of the array into a string separated by a space.

// Remove orange

// Add strawberry, kiwi, and grapes at the end

// Remove apple

// Add mango at the beginning of the array

// Add lemon, and grapefruit between mango and banana

// Remove banana and strawberry

// Create a new array called exoticFruits. Add 3 exotic fruits inside of this array. Create a new variable and assign it with the value of concatinating fruits array and exoticFruits array.

// Print the last two exotic fruits without altering the newly concatenated array.

const RafaelNoBadWords = "I am so tired of this badword food. I do not want this badword badword food."

// Man math is hard. Let's make our computer do it for us. Use reduce() to find the total of the numbers in numbersToAddUp
const numbersToAddUp = [99, 5677, 232, 84, 2, 231]

// ===== SPREAD OPERATOR ===== 

// Create a variable and assign a value of a copied array using the spread operator

// Create two arrays with any elements and connect both of them using the spread operator. Save the connected arrays into a new variable.

// Using the variable with the newly connected arrays, use spread operator to add something at the end.

// Using the variable with the newly connected arrays, use spread operator to add something at the beginning.
